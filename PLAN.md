I want to improve dramitaclly my User experince in this app. Right to left is not intuitive, and the design is not modern. 

I want to make it look like a real product, not a prototype. 

I want it to support correct RTL, and to be more intuitive to use. 

I want the fetch trends results to be more user friendly, maybe we can add the photo of the main article.
